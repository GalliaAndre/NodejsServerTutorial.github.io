# Simple server tutorials with Node.js

EVERYONE WOULD BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THESE EXAMPLES!
Yes, either you who ended up here by chance.

In every folder there is a README file which explain the content of the examples.

It's important to have a very basic knowledge of JSON and JavaScript.

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation).
It is a lightweight data-interchange format. Basically is a easy way to manage informations between machines. It is tipically structured as a collection of name/value pairs. 

**JavaScript** is an event-oriented and object-oriented language, tipically used for client web development. 

In these examples we are going to use the Node.js platform. It allows to use javascript not only for client-side, but also server-side applications. 

**First** thing to do is obviously [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/download/).
Then open cmd prompt and type `node`: you will see the version you just installed.

Then choose your favourite code editor (I use [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)). 
Create your project folder, right-click and open it with Brackets! 
All is ready, now open the first example and try something new!

In these examples we will use three Node.js' micro framework:
- `express`: server framework.
- `request`: simple way to make `http` calls.
- `body-parser`: middleware module to handle `http post` request in express.js

Simple server tutorials with Node.js

In every folder there is a README file which explain the content of the examples.

It's important to have a very basic knowledge of JSON and JavaScript.

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation).
It is a lightweight data-interchange format. Basically is a easy way to manage informations between machines. It is tipically structured as a collection of name/value pairs. 

**JavaScript** is an event-oriented and object-oriented langruage tipically used for client web developmet. 

In these examples we are going to use the Node.js platform. It allows to use javascript not only for client side applications, but also server-side. 

**First** thing to so is obviously [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/download/), then open your favourite editor (I use [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)). 
Create your project folder, right-click and open it with Brackets! 
All is ready, now open the first example and try something new!

Here we will use three Node.js' micro framework:
- `express`: server framework.
- `request`: simple way to make `http` calls.
- `body-parser`: middleware module to handle `http post` request in express.js
